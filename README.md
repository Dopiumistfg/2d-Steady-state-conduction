In our case , it being a 2d plate, we may ignore the PDE involving z

Hence the new equation becomes d/dx(KdT/dx) + d/dy(KdT/dy) = 0

Upon assuming dT/dx to be a finite difference, rather that a infinitesimally small chaange, we can convert it into a first order PDE

Upon further simplification setting boundary conditions, and converting the plate into a discretised mesh, we get 2 matrices

One of these will be, as mentioned in the code the matrix used to solve internal temperatures, and the other will consist of boundary conditions

the formula we will follow in this case will be 

T(up) + T(down) + T(left) + T(right) -4 x T(current)  = 0

in other words, the current temperature has to be an average of all other temperatures,

Let us take an example of a 4x4 plate, where the boundary conditions are known, i.e. T_Top = 0, T_bottom = 1000,T_ left = T_right = 0

Hence the matrix generated by the find ones function will look like 
 -4.  1.  1.  0.
  1. -4.  0.  1.
  1.  0. -4.  1.
  0.  1.  1. -4.
 
 The full formula would look like
 -4.  1.  1.  0.      T1        1000
  1. -4.  0.  1.  X   T2    =   0
  1.  0. -4.  1.      T3        0
  0.  1.  1. -4.      T4        0

This will give solution for the whole plate
